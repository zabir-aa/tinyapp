# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product

The web application greets user with a login prompt as the service is locked only for the registered users. The front page has both the login form for returning users and the register form for new users.
